The code is released for academic use only.

We use Matlab2015b to implement our algorithm. If you 
use lower version than Matlab2015b, please make sure
the functions such as pcread, pcdownsample are still 
supported. If there is something wrong in your use of 
the ransac.mex64 file, please re-mex the ransac.cpp on 
your machine to make it compatible.
